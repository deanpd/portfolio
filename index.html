      <h1>Hola, I'm Dean Davidson.</h1>
      <p>I'm a visual artist living in Bellingham, Washington, with my wife, son, two cats, frogs, and Rosie the tarantula. I specialize in graphic design with brand development, print layout, and motion graphics. As I've worked as a graphic designer, I've taken on the worlds of photo and video. I've had the pleasure of working with clients up and down the West Coast and served as an in-house graphic designer and videographer.</p>
